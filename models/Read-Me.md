# Place models here

To start with the sample, go to the MXnet super resolution [zoo model](https://github.com/WolframRhodium/Super-Resolution-Zoo)Â and download the relevant models. Then put the *json* & *param* files in the models folder.

I have tested [SRGAN_2x](https://github.com/WolframRhodium/Super-Resolution-Zoo/tree/master/SRGAN), [ESRGAN_4x](https://github.com/WolframRhodium/Super-Resolution-Zoo/tree/master/ESRGAN), [DBPN_2x](https://github.com/WolframRhodium/Super-Resolution-Zoo/tree/master/DBPN) and [RCAN_BIX2](https://github.com/WolframRhodium/Super-Resolution-Zoo/tree/master/RCAN) models with the [ESRGAN.py](https://github.com/sa-mustafa/super-resolution-mxnet/blob/master/ESRGAN.py) sample and [LapSRN](https://github.com/WolframRhodium/Super-Resolution-Zoo/tree/master/LapSRN/pytorch-LapSRN%40twtygqyy) model with the [LapSRN.py](https://github.com/sa-mustafa/super-resolution-mxnet/blob/master/LapSRN.py) sample.
