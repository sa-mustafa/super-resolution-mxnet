# MXNet Super Resolution Sample

There are a lot of super resolution python samples for frameworks such as Tensorflow or PyTorch. However, for MXNet samples were missing, except for the very simple [example](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/versions/master/tutorials/onnx/super_resolution.html) in the documentation. 

There is a very good collection of pre-trained super resolution models in MXNet in the [Wolfram](https://github.com/WolframRhodium/Super-Resolution-Zoo) Github repo.  But again, a sample code for running the models is not provided. So, I created these two simple examples. The models I chose are among some of the best performers in 2019.
